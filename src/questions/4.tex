{[10 marks]} The {\it diameter} of a tree is the length of the longest simple path
between nodes of the tree. Design an efficient divide and conquer algorithm to compute the diameter of a rooted binary tree. Your algorithm may use the following operations on trees that each have time complexity $\Theta(1)$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textsc{Root}($T$) --- Returns the root node of the tree $T$.
    \item \textsc{LeftChild}($T$, $v$) --- Returns the node that is the left child of $v$ in $T$; or $\emptyset$ if $v$ does not have a left child.
    \item \textsc{RightChild}($T$, $v$) --- Returns the node that is the right child of $v$ in $T$; or $\emptyset$ if $v$ does not have a right child.
\end{itemize}

Provide a pseudocode and a $\Theta$ bound in the runtime analysis. A proof of correctness is always required.
